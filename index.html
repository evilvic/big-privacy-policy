    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>All data is stored locally on your device. We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access. However, please note that no system is ever completely secure.</p>

    <h2>5. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    <p>As all your data is stored locally on your device, you have full control over it. You can access, modify, or delete your data at any time within the app.</p>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our services are not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete such information.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new privacy policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. You are advised to review this privacy policy periodically for any changes.</p>

    <h2>9. Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data (GDPR)</h2>

    <h2>10. California Privacy Rights (CCPA)</h2>
    <p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) provides California residents with specific rights regarding their personal information. As we do not collect or process personal information, these rights are not applicable in the context of our app.</p>

    <p>Our app does not integrate with or link to any third-party services that would have access to your data.</p>

    <h2>14. Do Not Track</h2>
